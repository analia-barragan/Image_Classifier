# Udacity Project: Image Classifier
This is the second project of the Udacity Nanodegree *Intro to Machine Learning*

# Description

This project was divided into two parts. 
In part one an image classifier had to be implemented on Jupyter Notebook using a pretrained network from Pytorch. This
classifier had the task of classifying flowers.

In part two the trained deep neural network had to be converted into a Python Script application that others can run
from the command line.
